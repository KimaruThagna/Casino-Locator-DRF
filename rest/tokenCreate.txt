To create tokens for existing users in the users table,
run the following command in the python  shell

from django.contrib.auth.models import user
from rest_framework.authtokens.models import Token

for user in User.objects.all()
    Token.objects.get_or_create(user=user)

serializing in the terminal
import from models
import from serializers
obj=model.first()
obj_data=SerializerClass(obj)
obj_data.data................this displays serialized data

Consider token security such as refreshing it. Maybe, a renewal algorithm such that an account
will have a new token in  every 10 min
BasicAuth is needed to log in in order to avail the token since subsequent requests are token authenticated
basic curl commands:
curl -H "Authorization: token b1cyvecbucr\6r183r\1\8\648" http://1270.0.1:8000api/Casinos/
curl -X POST "username: username password: pass" http://1270.0.1:8000/login/
